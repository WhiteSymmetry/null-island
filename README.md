#Null Island
I couldn't find a Null Island GeoJSON file, so I made one.

Started with the [SVG from GNIP](https://github.com/gnip/null-island), played with it in Illustrator & Photoshop to export a clean outline, resize and position in ArcGIS Desktop, output to Shapefile and convert to GeoJSON with gdal.

Thanks to Ben Balter for the [simple instructions](http://ben.balter.com/2013/06/26/how-to-convert-shapefiles-to-geojson-for-use-on-github/) on Shapefile to GeoJSON conversion.
